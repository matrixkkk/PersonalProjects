;Oily Film pixel shader from the alien's gauntlets modified to use a glow map
;instead of the warp effect map.  t0 is the packed texture coordinate and t1 
;is N dot V.  If we assume that the thin film on the gauntlet is of uniform 
;thickness, then N dot V actually approximates the distance that light travels
;through the film and is accurate in the lookup of the thin film ramp. The 
;final output is summarized below.
;
;B  = Base map
;TF = Thin film interference map
;G  = Glow map
;v0 = Diffuse lighting from vertex shader
;v1 = Specular lighting from vertex shader
;Oc = Output color
;Oa = Output alpha
;
;Oc = B * v0 + TF * v1 + G
;Oa = 1
